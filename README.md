## My Process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### What I Learned

I learned that we can use custom data- attributes for any element and associate that element with our desired information that we can later access or manipulate with javascript or use it in the CSS as an attribute selector.

### Continued development

I will be focusing on building responsive web pages.

### Useful resources
